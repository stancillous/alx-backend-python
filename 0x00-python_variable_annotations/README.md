<h2>Typed Annotations in Python</h2>
<h5>In python, typed annotations serve the following purpose:</h5>
<h5>
1. Code documentation: thanks to them, a developer reading type-annotated code (his own or someone elseâ€™s) will know exactly what type each variables is supposed to be. This helps reduce bugs and exceptions and accelerate the development cycle.

</h5>
<h5>
2. Linting and validation: code editors and continuous integration (CI) pipelines can be configured to automatically validate type-annotated code at build-time and catch bugs before they make it to production.
